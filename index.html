        <h2>Reflective Journal </h2>
        <p>I am currently year 4th year undergraduate at Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology 
          following the Data Science specialization. I am also working as an Associate Data Engineer at 
          ARIMACLANKA company. I am currently adopting myself to grow myself to suit professional 
          world. My main objective is to be successful person in my career by being able to balance my 
          work and life. I am also motivated to achieve higher success in the career ladder related to the 
          industrial perspective of my specialization. During my first and second years we had modules like 
          ‘Business Communication’, ‘Employability Skills Development’ which were related to growing 
          up of essential skills to suit the professional world. As time passed on with the heavy schedule 
          academic and work good things that we learned were not practiced and were long forgotten. But 
          as I was growing in my career, I understood that these skills, I must increase them and then it was 
          during my 4th year 1st semester module I had ‘Preparation for the Professional World’ module. 
          As I was confident about my skills this module helped me to increase by helping me to learn about 
          formal writings, telephone etiquettes, interview skills and a lot of important things that needed 
          daily in the industry to keep our self-highlighted among others. During this course I was able to 
          add an additional set of skills to my tool box which helped me to keep my standards at work place 
          in the professional manner.</p>

              <p class="description">When I actually started learning this module, I was really not interested in attending the lectures. 
                This was mainly I was paying more attention to my other modules and sadly I had less time for 
                my academics since I was working too. When the first assignment was given in order to submit 
                the assignment I started going through the lectures. Then I understood that these is one of the 
                modules which can groom me to suit to the professional world. The lectures and the way things 
                were taught capture my interest. Just after my assignment 1 submissions I started attending regular 
                to the lectures without cutting them because I felt in interest of the course content since I knew 
                this will improve my skill set. Whenever I learn something for example like Formal Writing and 
                try that at my workplace, I felt so confident about myself and satisfied that I am improving step by 
                step and increasing my professionalism to suit the industry.</p>

              <p class="description">Evaluating on the module I felt although I have not given up much priority for these professional 
                skills development modules, I had a thirst to improve my skills set. During the PPW module was 
                taught to me at the university I was already doing a Job and I come across many business 
                professionals and industry experts who admired me to act and communicate like them in much 
                professional way. I always had admired the professional etiquettes they maintain during work and 
                free time. Since this was the 4th year managing my academics with work was a heavy load which 
                had caused me for spending much attention on these while also spending some time to my Research 
                Project activities. This is something which I realized during the middle of the course that due these 
                activities I am not spending enough tome to the module which is a barrier I have to break. As I had 
                a thirst to improve my skills set, I realized that the problem here is improper time management. 
                Due to my Research Project activities work and other academics I am not allocating some time to 
                the module underestimating that just by submitting assignments I can finish the module. But the 
                exact impact was just after the assignment 1 submission which helped to understand that this 
                module has the content which is just what I wanted and searched for some time to improve my 
                skills set. When I started implementing the stuff that I learned like formal writing, telephone 
                etiquettes, business email writing I was able to realize that I am growing my self to suit the industry 
                with the right set of skills.</p>

              <p class="description">For my first submission I had refer few lectures like Business writing, formal writing and I also 
                viewed the lecture on Presentation Skills. Fortunately, because there was a submission I went 
                through lectures and the slides but by going through the lectures I was able to understand how 
                should I achieve formal writing or what ways I can improve my writing. Presentation skills 
                although I knew how to present as far as I understood the module was speaking about how to 
                structure the content in a presentation and how to make our presentations effective. Presentation 
                skills are really necessary because I daily get into a presentation during my office calls it may be 
                present my profess updates or to present and explain some kind of work I was doing. It also taught 
                me how I should create professional contents. It was then I realized my mistake I must manage my 
                time and spend extra time to this module such that I should not be reluctant thinking before the 
                submission by going through the lecture slides, I will be able to capture everything. I realized that 
                I should not be so overconfident rather I should spend some extra weight to incorporate these skills 
                into my work environment. These days as it is more likely to work from home emails, frequent 
                calls and presentations virtually is a normal working environment. The lectures which came after 
                that which were related formal writing helped me to increase my email writing and memo writing 
                skills. When I went through the lectures, I understood the kind of common mistakes that I do every 
                day during writing emails and no one was there to correct me. Fortunately, as I saw in these 
                lectures, I was able to correct them and write emails properly. I was ashamed thinking of what 
                would the receivers would have felt when going through my emails but now I am confident with 
                way I am writing and the way I am structuring my email and presentations. During the lecture I 
                was able to improve my telephone etiquettes as online working has a lot of online calls. I captured 
                some of the techniques which were taught in the module to make my conversations more polite 
                and sound good. Before when I take calls I am kind of the person who makes the receiver confused 
                at the end of the call of what the message was but now after the module since I feel confident in 
                handling the receiver I am able to deliver the message effectively. I always like to be a good leader. 
                A good leader should practice good leadership skills. I was able to test my leadership qualities and 
                skills. But I saw my self and analyzed the skills that I lacked although I was passionate to groom 
                my self to the professional world. Report writing is another major knowledge that I got which now 
                I frequently apply in producing reports at works and also the report writing lecture helped greatly 
                for academic report writings and research project report writing to structure and organize in a much 
                standard way. At the end of the course I can analyze my self to where I started and where I am 
                now which had totally transformed the way I write, communicate, present, lead and so on. I can 
                now confidently see myself where I could stand in the next 5 years in the industry as these modules 
                not only gave me the skills but also the freedom and confidence to effectively and efficiently apply 
                my knowledge skills learned.  </p>

              <p class="description">In retrospect I have to take the full responsibility of not prioritizing my course work contents and 
                managing time. It’s a very important task where I learn to first manage my time or else in life 
                without proper time management, I will have to lose a lot of valuable things. Since I realized in 
                the middle and was able to. I feel that now I have given more priority for the module by allocating 
                the time properly and have gained a lot knowledge. However, as the learnings that I got I was able 
                to apply them in my work place directly and I saw the results were positive which increasing my 
                professional skills the love and interest for the module increased. I understand that the skills we 
                learn when we apply only, we tend to find the interest and improving nature which increases us 
                the interest to learn more. Now I feel that I learned this module during the right time where I think 
                that I was finding room for growth. Since I was working there was a real necessity to improve my 
                professional skills and getting the real-world scenarios to test them and see results improved the 
                interest to learn. I feel really thankful for the university for including such a module to the course 
                this is not directly related to Data Science but without professional skills not matter how much of 
                GPA or knowledge we had I believe we wont be able to be successful professional in the industry 
                without the write set of skills. This module had helped me realize my mistakes, correct them and 
                by increasing my level of confidence to walk confidently towards the industry and reach great 
                heights with professional standards. </p>

              <p class="description">In future, I have to make sure that I first properly plan my time and prioritize my work. I should 
                also take steps to practice the skills learned during this course. While moving on there might be 
                additional things that I could add to the skills set this is necessary.  Continuous growth is important 
                to keep the skills brushed and shine brightly. Since this improved my level of confidence moving 
                on in life in order to have confidence in the industry these kinds of skills should practiced in the 
                proper way which will also inspire other too. Along the way there will be additional skills which 
                I have to learn or new skills which come with the particular time just like the online system which 
                brought new working etiquettes to the industry I must be able to keep my updated and adapt to 
                new professional skills which I may need to shine in my professional career in future. Through 
                this module I learned how we can use simple things to make a big impact just like effectively 
                presenting your presentation and organizing the slides. As this module increased my confidence, I 
                shall keep learning more professional skills while practicing the once I learned to be a successful 
                professional so that one day, I can be a true example for my juniors. </p>

                <p>
                  <span>As a final year IT undergraduate, I managed to land an IT Expert role after my IT internship. SLIIT's well-designed program and clear schedule helped me secure my dream job right before graduation. However, IT is a new and competitive field in Sri Lanka, so I feel the knowledge I gained might not be enough in a year. With more and more people entering this growing field, I need to maximize my experience in the early years. This will not only make me valuable to my current company but also create a demand for the skills and professional approach I've gained through my internship.  </span>

                <p>
                  <span>To bridge the gap between my current skillset and my aspirations as a senior IT expert, I've identified several areas for improvement. Firstly, I need to expand my toolset by gaining hands-on experience with industry-standard technologies relevant to my role. While experience comes with time, I'm actively seeking opportunities to tackle more complex problems and broaden my problem-solving repertoire. Additionally, I acknowledge my tendency to avoid new challenges due to a heavy workload. To address this, I'll be more proactive in seeking out new use cases and expanding my professional network.  Furthermore, I'm committed to honing my professional skills, identified as a weakness during the PPW module. I'll actively practice what I've learned and continuously explore new areas. Finally, I recognize the need for improved time management. When faced with heavy workloads, I'll prioritize tasks more effectively to ensure efficient progress towards my goals.</span>
